During my academic studies, I did data processing: manipulating data, generalising it, representing it in  graphs using Python.  <br> Currently, I want to switch to commercial work, and be closer to the user: making their lives more convenient with user-friendly websites.

### Code example
** Task:** Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.
```
def digital_root(n):
    stroka = str(n)
    if len(stroka)<=1:
        print(stroka)
        return(int(stroka))
    else:
        if len(stroka)>1:
            summa = 0
            for i in range(0, len(stroka)):
                summa += int(stroka[i])
    stroka = summa

    return(digital_root(stroka)) 
```
### Languages
* **Russian** native
